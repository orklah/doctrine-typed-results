# doctrine-typed-results

## TODO
- Allow disabling assertions (gain performance but reduce runtime checks)
- Investigate on Template inheritance(@extends/@template-extends): https://psalm.dev/docs/annotating_code/templated_annotations/
- make sure every method in Query is in QueryInterface (not only in AbstractQuery) and simplify test
- add more tests (static analysis correctness and functionnality)
